I am pursuing Master's degree in [Robotics Department][Robotics] at [University of Michigan][Umich]. 

Currently, I'm working on the Human-Robot Handover project, especially focusing on the Motion Planning direction using [Stretch 2][Stretch] under the supervision of Professor [Christoforos Mavrogiannis][Chris] in the [Fluent Robotics Lab][Lab].

Before this, I graduated with a First Class Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China ([UNNC][UNNC]).

My interest is piqued by the perception, planning, and control aspects of robotics. In particular, I am drawn to the arenas of autonomous driving and mobile robots. Aside from my academic pursuits, I am an avid photographer (check my Gallery!) and anime enthusiast.
