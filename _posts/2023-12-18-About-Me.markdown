I am a first-year Ph.D. student studying Robotics in the [Kahlert School of Computing][KSOC] at the [University of Utah][Utah]. I'm a Research Assistant working in the Utah Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy ([LL4MA Lab][ll4ma]), where I'm advised by Professor [Tucker Hermans][Tucker]. My research focuses on Robot Learning for Manipulation. 

Previously, I earned my Master's degree in [Robotics][Robotics] from the [University of Michigan][Umich], where I was advised by Professor [Christoforos Mavrogiannis][Chris] in the [Fluent Robotics Lab][Lab].
Before this, I graduated with a First Class Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China ([UNNC][UNNC]).

Aside from my academic pursuits, I am a passionate photographer (check my [Gallery][Gallery]!) and anime enthusiast.
